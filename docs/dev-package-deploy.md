# Development, Packaging and Deployment
### With Go, Lambda and SAM

The [Twelve-Factor App](https://12factor.net/) documents best practices for building software-as-a-service, most of which apply to our Go FaaS app. Two of the factors cover how to develop and deploy an app:

* [Build, release, run](https://12factor.net/build-release-run) -- Strictly separate build and run stages
* [Dev/prod parity](https://12factor.net/dev-prod-parity) -- Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible

We can easily implement these these factors for our Go FaaS app with help of the [AWS SAM Local](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sam-local) development environment.

## Build with go cross-compiler

Go is a compiled language, so a build phase is implicit in every development workflow.

A killer feature Go brings to the table is a cross compiler. Mac, Windows and any other operating system with the Go tool chain has the capability to build Linux binaries with a single command.

A killer feature Lambda brings is that it's input is a simple `.zip` file, a format with ubiquitous support.

So our build and packaging process is two commands that run on virtually any computer:

```console
$ GOOS=linux go build -o main
$ zip main.zip main
```

Compare this to the tools and services required to build Docker images, EC2 AMIs or Heroku slugs...

## Develop with SAM Local

But a new problem arises... How do run assemble these function packages into an API on our development box? Enter [AWS SAM Local](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sam-local), a tool for local development and testing of serverless applications. It leverages Docker and the [lambci/lambda](https://hub.docker.com/r/lambci/lambda/) images to run the Linux binary in the `main.zip` packages.

### invoke

The simplest example is the `aws-sam-local local invoke` command:

```console
$ echo '{}' | aws-sam-local local invoke WorkerFunction
2018/02/24 15:27:01 Successfully parsed template.yml
2018/02/24 15:27:01 Connected to Docker 1.35

```

This offers a fairly faithful representation of the Lambda production environment.

### start-api

We can also run assemble our HTTP functions with `aws-sam-local local start-api`:

```console
$ aws-sam-local local start-api
2018/02/24 15:33:15 Connected to Docker 1.35
2018/02/24 15:33:15 Fetching lambci/lambda:go1.x image for go1.x runtime...

## run `curl http://localhost:3000`

2018/02/24 15:41:57 Invoking handler (go1.x)
2018/02/24 15:41:57 Decompressing handlers/dashboard/main.zip

```

This boots a local API Gateway that takes an HTTP request, invokes a function with the request event, and returns an HTTP response from the response event.

With a couple of first-party commands we can develop our app with a strong amount of dev/prod parity.

Compare this to the difference between developing an Rails app with `rails server` and deploying it to Elastic Beanstalk.

### make and watchexec

The final trick is to rebuild handler packages on every code change.

Thanks to the fact that the local API server unzips a handler package on every request, and Go effectively caches builds, we have a simple solution: rebuild all handlers in parallel on every change.

We can use`make`, the ubiquitous tool for generating binaries from source files with [`watchexec`](https://github.com/mattgreen/watchexec), a program that watches for file changes and re-runs a command.

```console
$ watchexec -f '*.go' 'make -j handlers'
```
> From [Makefile](../Makefile)

Again we find a simple solution with great dev/prod parity.

## CloudFormation package and deploy

Our `template.yml` AWS config file is a CloudFormation template of the [SAM dialect](https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model/blob/master/versions/2016-10-31.md). So we can lean on the `aws` CLI to release and run our app.

The release step is accomplished with the `aws cloudformation package` command. This uploads our `main.zip` files to S3 and writes a new CloudFormation template with the S3 URLs. The run step is executed with the `aws cloudformation deploy` command. This uses the CloudFormation API to update our resources -- such as updating Lambda functions to the new release.

```console
$ aws cloudformation package --output-template-file out.yml --s3-bucket $(BUCKET) --template-file template.yml
$ aws cloudformation deploy --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM --template-file out.yml --stack-name gofaas
```
> From [Makefile](../Makefile)

There's a lot of functionality baked into these commands like uploading package as efficiently as possible, creating new resources in dependency order, and safely rolling back updates on a failure. But it's all managed by CloudFormation.

The end result is glorious: a single config file that declares our entire app infrastructure, and a single command to deploy our app that generally takes less than a minute.

## Summary

An app with Go and SAM offers:

- Fast cross-compiled builds
- Single command release and run steps
- A development environment with strong production parity

We don't need to worry about:

- Dockerfile or docker-compose.yml files
- Code syncing
- Complex package formats
- Build services

Go and SAM makes it significantly easier to build and release applications with strong "dev/prod" parity.
